# simple-block-game 
[Made By Daniel Rehman]

This is a simple block game which is sorta like minecraft. its different than minecraft however, in that the world is finite, there is only creative and survival mode, its 2d, and not to mention there is only one type of non-air block, which is Dirt.
so actually its pretty different from minecraft, although its made under the same goals.

devlopment on it has ceased as i have been working on a different game, which is supposed to be more original, and more fun to play.
